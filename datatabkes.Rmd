# Using the DT package to create searchable JavaScript tables

[Instructions here](https://rstudio.github.io/DT/):

> "The R package DT provides an R interface to the JavaScript library DataTables. R data objects (matrices or data frames) can be displayed as tables on HTML pages, and DataTables provides filtering, pagination, sorting, and many other features in the tables."

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
install.packages('DT')
library(DT)
```
