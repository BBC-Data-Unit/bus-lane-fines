A decision was made to submit an FOI request based on a number of criteria:

* The data was not available publicly, and council press offices routinely ask journalists to submit these questions as an FOI request 
* Public interest: being able to paint a national picture of bus lane fines helps to raise awareness of how large a problem bus lane contraventions are
* Public interest: having local detail also provides a picture of how much variation there is in either contravention or enforcement, and therefore how consistent or not that might be
* Outliers (which can only be identified within the context of what is typical, i.e. by having figures for all areas) can help highlight areas where it may be that awareness needs to be raised further. If hundreds of drivers are being caught driving in one bus lane every day, it is of public interest to start a discussion about why that might be, and how that might be avoided. Are those people deliberately flouting the lanes and paying the fines as a very hefty toll charge? Or is it the case that many people are making a mistake? And if it’s the latter, are the signs adequate? If the aim of bus lane cameras is to stop people from driving where they shouldn’t, then highlighting the issue and making people aware of the ones that most people fall foul of may help.
* Tthe scale of interest in the story since publication (over 1 million views on the BBC report alone) does suggest that there is wide interest in the issue (although this is not the same as public interest) and stories like [Why drivers must be more aware of costly bus lane cameras](http://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/drivers-must-be-more-aware-of-costly-bus-lane-cameras/story-30176765-detail/story.html) suggest that it has indeed stimulated awareness of the offence, while [this story on a controversial bus lane near a hospital](http://www.portsmouth.co.uk/business/controversial-qa-hospital-bus-lane-named-one-of-the-most-profitable-for-fines-in-country-1-7846516) suggests it has stimulated important local debate about an ongoing issue.

*The original Freedom of Information request asked for the following:*

The locations (latitude and longitude and street address with postcode) of all bus lane cameras, whose images and recordings are used to issue fines/penalty notices to drivers who wrongly use the lanes. I do not require any information about cameras used simply for security or general CCTV monitoring. 
For each individual camera please state: 

1. The date it became operational (DD/MM/YYYY). 

2. The number of penalty charge notices issued to date since it was first switched on. 

3. The number of penalty charge notices issued during the financial year 2015-16. 

4. The gross income from any fines/penalties issued to drivers caught on the 
camera since it was activated. Please include expected income from fines/penalties still awaiting payment. 
5. The gross income from any fines/penalties issued to drivers caught on the camera in the 2015-16 financial year. 
6. The amount a driver must pay to settle a penalty charge.
