*The original Freedom of Information request asked for the following:*

The locations (latitude and longitude and street address with postcode) of all bus lane cameras, whose images and recordings are used to issue fines/penalty notices to drivers who wrongly use the lanes. I do not require any information about cameras used simply for security or general CCTV monitoring. 
For each individual camera please state: 

1. The date it became operational (DD/MM/YYYY). 

2. The number of penalty charge notices issued to date since it was first switched on. 

3. The number of penalty charge notices issued during the financial year 2015-16. 

4. The gross income from any fines/penalties issued to drivers caught on the 
camera since it was activated. Please include expected income from fines/penalties still awaiting payment. 
5. The gross income from any fines/penalties issued to drivers caught on the camera in the 2015-16 financial year. 
6. The amount a driver must pay to settle a penalty charge.
